# Design-Project-2020

Some bits of frontends build by me as part of our 3rd year design project.
The main objective of the project was to build a user friendly interface which acts as a platform to connect between buyers and sellers to sell or buy their used products.
This project is currently build exclusively for Maceians(Students of Mar Athanasius College of Engineering Kothamangalam).
We would like to extend our project in future such that such kinda website is avialable for each colleges.
